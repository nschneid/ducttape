Ducttape by Example

By Jonathan Clark

All examples in this tutorial are runnable and can be found in in the directory tutorial/

Basics
======

Basics: Running a single command
--------------------------------

 Syntax:
 * This is just a single command that writes output to stdout and stderr
 * Lines that begin with # are comments
 * Comment blocks preceeding task declarations are associated with that task

 Execution:
 * After ducttape has been added to your PATH, this workflow can be executed with:
   $ ducttape basic.tape
 * Artifacts from this workflow will be in the current directory of basic.tape (./)
 * This task will run in the working directory ./hello-world/baseline/1/work
 * stdout will be placed at ./hello-world/baseline/1/stdout.txt
 * To have ducttape write a bash script that runs this step to
      ./hello-world/baseline/commands.sh, use:
   $ ducttape --dry-run --write-scripts basic.tape

```bash
task hello_world {
  echo hi
  echo >&2 hello
}
```

 The ducttape_structure global is a special directive to ducttape (ignore it for now)

```bash
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Writing output files
----------------------------


 * Ducttape will assign the paths for the output files
   as something like ./hello-world-2/x and ./hello-world-2/y.txt
 * The environment variables x and y_txt will be set by
   ducttape before calling bash
 * Note that bash disallows variables containing .

```bash
task hello_world_2 > x y_txt {
  echo writing files $x and $y_txt...
  echo hello > $x
  echo world > $y_txt
}
```

 Since variables with dots are not allowed by bash (and therefore ducttape),
 ducttape allows you to specify the output file name
 This is useful so that:
 * types can still be automatically detected based on extension
 * it's easy to refer to outputs of programs with hardcoded output names (e.g. unix split)

```bash
task named_output < x=/etc/passwd > named=x.gz {
  cat $x | gzip > $named
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Reading input files
---------------------------


 * This task takes 2 input files (a and b) and produces no output
 * Ducttape will set the environment variables in $a and $b before invoking bash

```bash
task hello_world_3 < a=/etc/passwd b=/etc/hosts {
  echo "I will be reading files called $a and $b and doing nothing useful with them"
  cat $a>/dev/null
  cat $b>/dev/null
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Running tasks with dependencies
---------------------------------------

 First a step we already know about...

```bash
task first > x {
  for i in {1..10}; do
    echo $i >> $x
  done
}
```

 * We use first's output "x" as the input "a" by using the = operator
 * Instead of specifying an absolute path as before, we specify
   it as a dependency using the "$" prefix
 TODO: $first/x should become $x@first

```bash
task and_then < a=$x@first > x {
  cat < $a > $x
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Using parameters
------------------------


 * Parameters are for variables that aren't files
 * They are listed after inputs and outputs, using a double colon
 * Because we distinguish files from parameters, ducttape can check if input
   files exist before running length commands or submitting jobs to a scheduler

```bash
task param_step < in=/etc/passwd > out :: N=5 {
  echo "$in has $(wc -l < $in) lines"
  echo "The parameter N is $N"
  echo $N > $out
}
```

 * The distinction between files and parameters also means
   that parameters don't introduce temporal dependencies when
   they are references (like this step)
 * "no-dep" can start running in parallel with "param-step"

```bash
task no_dep :: X=$N@param_step {
  #echo "X=$N" # a bug! this would be caught by ducttape's static analysis of bash
  echo "X=$X"
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Anonymous configs
-------------------------


 TODO: More documentation

```bash
task hello_anonymous_world :: who=$someone {
  echo hello $who
}
```

 an anonymous configuration block
 this creates no additional directory structure

```bash
config {
  someone=world
}
```

Basics: Named configs
---------------------


 Named configs allow... TODO

```bash
task hello_named_world :: who=$someone {
  echo hello $who
}
```

 an named configuration block
 all tasks will be nested under an additional subdirectory called "World"

```bash
config World {
  someone=world
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: External config files
-----------------------------


 TODO: Why are these useful?

```bash
task hello_external_world :: who=$someone {
  echo hello $who
}
global {
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Global variables
------------------------


 TODO: Why are these useful?

```bash
task hello_global_world :: who=$someone {
  echo hello $who
}
```

 a block of global variables
 these are variables that should
 be shared among *all* configs

```bash
global {
  someone=world
  ducttape_structure=flat
}
```

Basics: Shorthand variable references
-------------------------------------

```bash
task hello :: foo=@ {
     echo ${foo}
}
task prev :: a=42 {
     echo ${a}
}
task next :: a=@prev {
     echo ${a}
}
global {
       foo="hello, world"
}
```

Packages
========

Packages: Using package versioning
----------------------------------


 * During R&D, software often changes while a workflow is running
 * To reproduce a workflow, you need to know what version of
   the software you ran
 * in, out, and N are shown only to illustrate syntax

```bash
task lunchtime_with_git : lunchpy {
  $lunchpy/lunch.py Indian Mexican Italian
}
```

 * Build commands are only called when versioner indicates a new version
 The following versioners are built-in to ducttape and implemented under $DUCTTAPE/builtins:
 * git
 * svn

 Note: We don't actually need to compile anything for python code,
 but for the sake of example we'll make this program run a bit faster

```bash
package lunchpy :: .versioner=git .repo="git://github.com/mjdenkowski/lunchpy.git" .ref=HEAD {
  python -m compileall .
}
```

 The idea here is to reproduce a repository-checkout-and-build within the context of a larger workflow system.
 This can become important in computational research in which software updates and experiments
 rapidly iterate with many code updates happening between experiments. For the sake of
reproducibility, it is important to know and be able to reproduce *exactly* the
 software configuration used in each experiment.

Packages: Understanding the git versioner

```

############################################################################
 The following implementation of a git versioner is actually built-in and
 automatically available to all workflows -- it is provided here for clarity
############################################################################

 * Checkout is run in a sanboxed directory and $dir will be a subdirectory (makes using git easier)
 * All other commands are run inside $dir
 * As we will see with inline branches, specializations such as checkout and update
   inherit all of their parent's parameters so that update has visibility of $repo and $rev
 * repo_version should return an *absolute* revision identifier. This identifier should include any branch information,
   if relevant.
 * local_version should return current *absolute* revision relative to the repository from 
   which the tool was checked out. This version should *never* be a relative, mutable
   revision identifier such as HEAD or TRUNK.

```bash
versioner git :: repo ref {
  action checkout > dir {
    git clone $repo $dir
  }
  action repo_version > version {
    git ls-remote $repo $ref | cut -f1 > $version
  }
  # TODO: Can we do without this? Just check repo version as we checkout? (potential race condition)
  # Used to confirm version after checkout
  action local_version > version date {
    git rev-parse HEAD > $version
    git log -1 | awk '/^Date/{$1=""; print}' > $date
  }
}
```

Adapting for Your Environment
-----------------------------

Currently, system specific modifications such as where prefix, etc is located is recommended to be done by copying the build scripts. This may seem bad, but build system and repository system already abstract fairly complicated operations. Each package should generally contain small scripts, which act more or less like configuration files.

However, it is considered best practice to have variables for such things on each package block rather than buried in the commands. For example, you should make it easy to modify the number of cores used in the build for make -j, scons -j, bjam -j, etc.

HyperWorkflows
==============

HyperWorkflows: What are HyperWorkflows?
----------------------------------------


 Experimentation often requires one to run similar sequences of tasks
 in a variety of configurations. To compactly represent such workflows,
 ducttape provides HyperWorkflows.

 For example, if we want to determine the effect of data size on some task,
 we could run the task several times, using input files of differing sizes,
 as below.

 This step shows the simplest way to pack (i.e. create a hyperworkflow)
 Parentheses with "fileName=(packName: a=x, b=y)" indicates that we will
 have branches "a" and "b" for file "f" and the name of the Branch Point
 (aka Pack) will be "packName".
 The file "x" will be used for branch a and the file "y"
 will be used when the branch b is active.

 * This task will result in two output directories:
   ./has-branches/baseline/1/work
   ./has-branches/bigger/1/work

 Because a is the first branch, it is considered the Baseline branch.
 Therefore, it is given the special directory name "baseline". This
 will become important later.

 Because there is a task with more than one Branch, we say that
 this workflow has more than one Realization (which can be thought of
 as a single DAG derivation of this HyperDAG).

 Relative paths *as inputs* are resolved relative to this .tape file.
 (Remember, relative paths as outputs are resolved relative to the task's working directory)

```bash
task has_branches < in=(WhichSize: smaller=small.txt bigger=big.txt) > out {
  cat < $in > $out
}
```

 Since its parent task has several branches (smaller and bigger),
 this task will be run once for each parent branch.

 * This task will also result in two output directories:
   ./parent-has-branches/baseline/1/work
   ./parent-has-branches/bigger/1/work

```bash
task parent_has_branches < in=$out@has_branches {
  wc -l $in
}
```

HyperWorkflows: The default one off plan
----------------------------------------


 TODO: What is a plan?

 Most HyperWorkflows involve more than one dimension of experimentation.
 That is, there is more than one packed file/parameter among the workflow's
 tasks. In this example, we will see how to run these variations as
 "one off" experiments.

 We start with a task much like the previous example

```bash
task one_off_1 < in=(WhichSize: smaller=small.txt bigger=big.txt) > out {
  cat < $in > $out
}
```

 And now add a child task that also has a packed parameter with multiple branches
 a subdirectory will be created under the task directory for one_off_2
 for each realization: one-smaller, one-bigger, two-smaller, two-bigger

 Notice that the realization directory name is formed by first sorting
 the active branches by their branch point names and then removing
 any "baseline" branches

```bash
task one_off_2 < in=$out@one_off_1 :: N=(N: one=1 two=2) {
  head -n $N < $in
}
```

 By default, ducttape will run each of these as "one off" experiments: Ducttape
 runs each workflow to completion (still sharing as much substructure as possible)
 using each branch of every Branch Point, but using the baseline branch for all other Packs.
 With the default One Off strategy, the following 4 directories will result from running
 this HyperWorkflow:
 * ./one_off_1/Baseline.baseline/1
 * ./one_off_1/WhichSize.bigger/1 
 * ./one_off_2/Baseline.baseline/1 (with the baseline branch "small" as one-off-1/in)
 * ./one_off_2/N.two/1 (with the baseline branch "small" as one-off-1/in)

HyperWorkflows: Sequence Branch Points
--------------------------------------


 Branches can also be created based on re-running the task multiple times
 * This can be useful when the underlying task makes calls to a random number generator (e.g. optimizers)
 * The step receives the integer ID of this trial as a parameter
 * Ducttape handles the assignment of sequential ID numbers to whichTrial by the 1..10 construction

```bash
task run_several_times > x :: trial=(WhichTrial: 1..10) {
  # Use bash's built-in random number generator
  echo $RANDOM > $x
}
```

HyperWorkflows: Custom realization plans
----------------------------------------

 We start with the same example from part 2

```bash
task planned_1 < in=(whichSize: smaller=small.txt bigger=big.txt) > out {
  cat < $in > $out
}
```

 And add a sequence to this step

```bash
task planned_2 < in=$out@planned_1 :: N=(N: one=1 two=2) M=(M: 1..10) {
  head -n $N < $in \
    | head -n $M
}
```

 Defining work plans to get more than just one-off experiments (this is intended primarily for config files)
 ducttape can be called with "ducttape -P Basics" to run cross products of branches by adding lines
 like the following to config files:

```bash
plan Basics {
  # 4 experiments/realizations: the branches one and two with with all branches of whichSize
  # The * operator indicates a cross-product
  # The "score" indicates that score is the goal task ("target" in GNU Make lingo)
  # and only dependencies of that task should be run
  reach planned_2 via (whichSize: smaller) * (N: one two) * (M: 1..10)
  # * 2 experiments/realizations: just the large model (e.g. if it takes much longer to run)
  # * "planned_1 and planned_2" indicates that those 2 tasks are the goal tasks
  #   This is used only to demonstrate syntax. Since planned_1 is a parent of planned_2,
  #   mentioning it has no effect in this case
  reach planned_1, planned_2 via (whichSize: bigger) * (N: one) * (M: 2 8)
}
```

HyperWorkflows: Branch Grating
------------------------------

 TODO: Unfinished tutorial step
 TODO: Example of grafting multiple branches (from different branch points) using comma
 TODO: Example of one input performing a graft and another input of the same task not grafting

 Branch grafting allows the selection of exactly one branch from a branch point that
 has been defined by a task or one of its parents. At the task and input where the branch graft is requested,
 the specified branch is taken to be the only branch that will ever be used *for that task, input pair*.
 The task at which the graft was requested will then have no further visibility of that branch point -- nor
 will any dependents of that task have visibility of the branch point. 

 if we have a tokenizer that we'd like to run on the training, dev, and test set
 and then later using exactly one branch from that branch point

```bash
task preproc < in=(DataSet: train=big.txt test=small.txt) > out {
  cat < $in > $out
}
task trainer < in=$out@preproc[DataSet:train] > model {
   cat < $in > $model
}
task tester < in=$out@preproc[DataSet:test] > hyps {
  cat < $in > $hyps
}
```

HyperWorkflows: Nested Branch Points
------------------------------------

```bash
task uses_nested < file=$ref_test :: N=$num_refs {
  echo "I will be reading file $file with $N refs"
  head -n $N $file
}
global {
  # Adding multiple branches from a config file
  # TODO: Another example with multiple language pairs
  #       (multiple config files, each which introduces a realization?)
  num_refs=(
    Test:
    baseline=(
      NumRefs:
      oneRef=1
      multiRef=4
    )
    mt02=(
      NumRefs:
      oneRef=1
      multiRef=16
    )
  )
  ref_test=(
    Test:
    baseline=(
      NumRefs:
      oneRef=small.txt
      multiRef=small.txt
    )
    mt02=(
      NumRefs:
      oneRef=big.txt
      multiRef=big.txt
    )
  )
}
```

Running Multiple Instances (Processes) of Ducttape
--------------------------------------------------

Ducttape supports running processs of itself for the same workflow and config. It uses file-based locking to ensure that the processes don't touch the same task at the same time. Ducttape ensures that these workflows will not deadlock each other.

For example, if process A of the workflow starts running first, and then process B starts running later, process B will only rerun any tasks that were planned by process A iff they failed; otherwise, process B will reuse the output generated by process B. If you desire to invalidate the output of process A, you must first kill process A.

However, if there are 3 or more processs of ducttape running at the same time, Ducttape does not guarantee which process will begin running the task first. For example, say process A starts first, and processs B and C start later. Then if some task T fails, either process B or process C will non-deterministically take it over and begin running it.

For this reason, this functionality of having multiple processs is primarily useful for 2 purposes:

* Adding additional realizations to the workflow's plan without modifying the workflow Fixing outright bugs in tasks that will definitely cause certain tasks to fail. This  allows the second process to continue running these doomed tasks and their dependents  to complete the workflow.

Submitters
==========

Submitters: Shell
-----------------


 Using the shell submitter is equivalent
 to directly typing each tasks' commands on the command line

```bash
task hello_shell {
  echo hello
}
```

 $COMMANDS are the bash commands from some task
 In this case, the variable will contain "echo hello"

```bash
submitter shell :: COMMANDS {
  action run > exit_code {
    eval $COMMANDS
  }
}
```

Submitters: Sun Grid Engine (Simple)
------------------------------------

```bash
task hello_sge :: .submitter=sge .walltime="00:01:00" .vmem=1g .q=all.q {
  echo hello
}
```

 cpus, vmem, walltime, q: these can be passed as parameters to each task: .cpus .vmem .walltime .q
 COMMANDS: the bash commands from some task
 TASK, REALIZATION, CONFIGURATION: variables passed by ducttape

```bash
submitter sge :: vmem walltime q
              :: COMMANDS
              :: TASK REALIZATION CONFIGURATION {
  action run {
    wrapper="ducttape_job.sh"
    echo "#$ -S /bin/bash" >> $wrapper
    echo "#$ -q $q" >> $wrapper
    echo "#$ -l h_rt=$walltime" >> $wrapper
    echo "#$ -j y" >> $wrapper
    echo "#$ -o localhost:$PWD/job.out" >> $wrapper
    echo "#$ -N $CONFIGURATION-$TASK-$REALIZATION" >> $wrapper
    # Bash flags aren't necessarily passed into the scheduler
    # so we must re-initialize them
    echo "set -e # stop on errors" >> $wrapper
    echo "set -o pipefail # stop on pipeline errors" >> $wrapper
    echo "set -u # stop on undeclared variables" >> $wrapper
    echo "set -x # show each command as it is executed" >> $wrapper
    # The current working directory will also be changed by most schedulers
    echo "cd $PWD" >> $wrapper
    echo "$COMMANDS" >> $wrapper
    # Use SGE's -sync option to prevent qsub from immediately returning
    qsub -sync y $wrapper
  }
}
```

Appendix A: Directory Structure
-------------------------------

Destination Directory
---------------------

$DEST is by default the $PWD from which you run ducttape This may become configurable at some point.

You can also define inside your config the value "ducttape.dest _ dir=/my/directory" as the destination directory.

Packages
--------

Packages get built in $DEST/ducttape.packages/$PACKAGE _ NAME/$PACKAGE _ VERSION

The Attic
---------

Partial output or invalidated output from previous runs gets moved to $DEST/ducttape.attic/$TASK _ NAME/$REALIZATON _ NAME/$WORKFLOW _ VERSION. This may help prevent accidental deletion of data and can help diagnose issues if tasks fail repeatedly. The workflow version is incremented every time the workflow is executed.

"Flat" Structure
----------------

Iff the "ducttape.structure=flat" directive is in your configuration, tasks will be stored in $DEST/$TASK _ NAME. We refer to this directory as $TASK.

The bash code in your task block will start off with its cwd as $TASK and its output files including ducttape _ stdout.txt, ducttape _ exit _ code.txt, and ducttape _ version.txt, ducttape _ submitter.sh will be written there. If you re-run the workflow, any partial output may be moved to The Attic (see above).

If you later choose to switch to "ducttape.structure=hyper", you will need to follow the special instructions below.

"Hyper" Structure
-----------------

If you do not specify the structure or "ducttape.structure=hyper" is in your configuration, tasks will be stored in $DEST/$TASK _ NAME/$REALIZATION _ NAME. We refer to this directory as $TASK.

Just as in the flat structure, the bash code in your task block will start off with its cwd as $TASK and its output files including ducttape _ stdout.txt, ducttape _ exit _ code.txt, and ducttape _ version.txt, ducttape _ submitter.sh will be written there. If you re-run the workflow, any partial output may be moved to The Attic (see above).

Config Directories
------------------

A basic workflow without any configs (the configuration blocks using the "config" keyword") or an anonymous config such as "config {}" will have the the structure defined by flat or hyper above. However, each config is housed in its own top-level directory under which all tasks live.

For the "flat" structure, this makes the $TASK directory: $DEST/$CONF _ NAME/$TASK _ NAME

For the "hyper" structure, this makes the $TASK directory: $DEST/$CONF _ NAME/$TASK _ NAME/$REALIZATION _ NAME

Transitioning from "Flat" to "Hyper"
------------------------------------

If you started with a flat structure and want to use hyper, ducttape will detect that you changed your structure preference and warn you that the directory structures are incompatible. You'll need to add a special transitional directory as the destination of hyperworkflow tasks, so set "ducttape.transitional _ dir=/my/director/hyperdir". We will refer to this directory as $TRANS. Your original flat tasks won't be moved, but all new tasks will be placed in $TRANS.

For the new hyper structure, this makes the $TASK directory: $TRANS/$TASK _ NAME/$REALIZATION _ NAME Or if a conf name is specified: $TRANS/$CONF _ NAME/$TASK _ NAME/$REALIZATION _ NAME

Your original flat tasks will be symlinked into $TRANS as: $TRANS/$TASK _ NAME/baseline - >  $DEST/$TASK _ NAME, since each flat task represents the baseline branch of the Baseline branch point in a hyperworkflow.

TODO: This README file needs to be updated.

Job control
-----------

Q. What if I want to change the structure of a workflow while it is running? A. No problem. Any tasks that are currently running will always continue to run. All other tasks defined in the previous version of the workflow, but not defined by the new version of the workflow will be cancelled by default (this can be overridden -- it might be useful to override if you want to submit several different sets of one-off experiments). Tasks that were defined in the old version of the workflow and are now redefined by new version of the workflow workflow will replace their old definitions (therefore, the old version of the tasks and all of its dependencies will be cancelled).

Why? Ducttape workflows are submitted to an always-running daemon. There is always one daemon per machine, and you are responsible for making sure you submit jobs from one head node per cluster (ducttape makes some attemps to complain if multiple daemons are pointed at the same directory on a shared filesystem).

Q. What if I want to change the input files to a workflow while it is running? A. Ducttape can't guarantee the success of doing this  while  the workflow is running. A currently-executing step might be using the file you intend to replace. If you're confident this is not the case, go for it. But we warned. See below for details on switching out input files.

Q. What if I want to change the input files when a workflow is partially completed / between runs? A. Just as ducttape manages the versions of the software packages in your workflow, it also checks if file versions differ (via a SHA1 or other heuristics). If they differ, you have 2 options: 1) Instruct ducttape to invalidate and rerun all tasks (and dependents) that use the changed input or 2) Instruct ducttape to ignore the change. In the latter case, ducttape will remember the change and keep a note of it (in case you notice strange inconsistencies later).

TODO: Make example inputs workflows that are part of the tutorial instead of just throwing words at this issue. (These are then unit tests as well).
